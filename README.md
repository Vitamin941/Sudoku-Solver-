# Sudoku-Solver-
This is a fork of Tim's Ruscica work.(https://github.com/techwithtim/Sudoku-GUI-Solver).  
Small updates in code. I added a some tests with unit-test and generator module, it is clear from the name that it generate a sudoku. 

Special thanks to Tim for his tutorial about this work.
